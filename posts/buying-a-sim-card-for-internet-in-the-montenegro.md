For our trip to Montenegro, we have decided to buy a local sim-card in the Tivat airport. We have found a small shop at the airport and seen this advertisement:

This ad tells about:

> 500 GB of internet. 15 days = 10 euro, 30 days = 15 euro.

We have chosen the package for 15 days because we had a 2-week trip:

After the purchase, we have swapped the sim-card in the phones and the internet has start work very well. Montenegro has a good 4G coverage, even in mountains.

To buy a local sim card you require to provide your passport or European ID.

We had been driving in Montenegro for 2 weeks, listening to Spotify and the internet was awesome in every part of this country. We have crossed the Croatian, Albanian and Bosnian borders and the roaming was working only on the Bosnian side.
