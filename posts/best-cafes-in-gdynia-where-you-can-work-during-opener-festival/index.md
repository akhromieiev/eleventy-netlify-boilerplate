In the summer of 2024, we attended the [Opener festival](https://opener.pl/) in Gdynia, Poland. I want to share with you some cafes/locations we visited and work.

## Cyganeria

This place was very close to the city center. Tables and sockets are comfortable for work. Also, a lot of parking places were available.

We have ordered toasts with salmon and i still remember how tasty it was. Highly recommend.

**Address**: [3 Maja 27, Gdynia](https://g.co/kgs/KtRBVdq)

## Flow

Flow Cafe in Gdynia is more for chilling and to take a breath of sea air. I saw some tables inside, but it was hard to find a sockets.

Сafe exterior:

Here is one of our breakfasts with salmon:

This is our total bill for 2 breakfasts, 2 coffees, and an asparagus plate:

## Hygge

This cafe is close to the [Flow Cafe](#flow) and perfect for remote work. It has all the coffee shop vibes, tables, and sockets.

It has enough place to work in pairs. Interior:
