# Introduction

In May 2024 we visited Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸. I took a EUR card from a Polish bank ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± and tried to get cash from ATMs with zero fees. I tried almost every popular ATM and in this post want to highlight ATMs with 0 fee.

Let's explore what I found.

# Unicaja

When I searched on the internet, Unicaja was number 1 on the list of no-fee ATMs. I tried to withdraw in different nominals in Seville and Alicante and 0% commission was always. The bonus is that every ATM provided an option for small amounts (banknotes like 5,10,20,50).

Also, I found that in 2020 [Unicaja acquired Liberbank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberbank#cite_note-6), and some of these ATMs still work under Unicaja's name. Fortunately with zero fee too. Frankly, Liberbank is the same as Unicaja.

# Ing

This ATM was a discovery since I did not expect that it would issue money without a commission. I tried 2 times (20â‚¬ and 500â‚¬) in Alicante and every time it gave me money with 0 fee.
