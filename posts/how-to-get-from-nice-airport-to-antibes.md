It has good air-conditioning (from my own experience) and USB sockets.

In Antibes it stops in the following stations:

- Pôle d’Echanges d’Antibes
- La Régence
- Pont du Lys
- Les Eucalyptus

**Fare**: **9.4€** per person
**Time**: 30-60 minutes

## Bus 620

The bus 620 from Nice to Cannes is the cheapest option to get Antibes from Nice Aeroport, but you need to walk from Terminal 2 for around 15-20 minutes to **Aeroport Promenade** bus station.

This is the cheapest option because it stops on every corner, but if you are on a budget and have only one bag it can. Air-condition was bad in this bus.

**Fare**: **2.1€** per person
**Time**: 60 minutes

# By Train

You must walk from Terminal 2 to **Nice Saint-Augustin** train station. The distance is 1.5km (1 mile), so it will take about 15-20 min to get there.

Uber and Bolt work in French Rivera so that you can book a trip in your app. You need to have **45-70 euro** for a taxi and don't forget to check the traffic jams, because the traffic is heavy in the season.
